I only have very vague ideas at the moment. This will take much more than one hour!

Local repositories don't seem to have much, or I fail to see their value.
I mean things like http://opendatacanarias.es/datos/dataset?tags=sanitaria

I will look at the suggested sites...

I will write my own ideas ...

1) Maybe look at tripadvisor and comments on infections so we can detect outbreaks?
http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/Data/ 435MB - does that look like useful data?

In general: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614504/

2) https://www.kaggle.com/openfoodfacts/world-food-facts
I'd like to link that with data from local production, to see if say vegetarianism could be locally sustainable?

3) solar prospections: data from sun on territory, plus people and energy use, so as to see the size of the market

4) gun ownership vs. gun murders (not suicides), country by country: is US an outlier?
http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9183525/gun-violence-statistics has some info chart 6
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country
